# Tasks
* Make `ingress-nginx` a `DaemonSet` (How do I do it declaratively? A patch? `kustomize`?)
* Why is the `emanote` container in the `exobrain` pod not logging anything?
* Try to set the `--control-plane-endpoint` to `cervantes.haff.xyz`
* Try to set a load balancer for all nodes so I can point my subdomains there
* Set a dashboard readonly user, follow [this guide](http://blog.zachinachshon.com/k8s-dashboard/)
