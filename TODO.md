# Tasks
* Try to set the `--control-plane-endpoint` to `cervantes.haff.xyz`
* Try to set a load balancer for all nodes so I can point my subdomains there. UPDATE: Actually just use a hetzner LB for my ingress-nginx
* `cert-manager` in my ingress helmfile, maybe even try setting the cluster from 0 using just helmfiles
* A controller that removes pods after some time specified by an annotation
* (Emanote) Should allow specifying several repositories to create a layered zettelkasten
* A krew plugin that allows deploying a `pgcli` connection to a Zalando's postgres deployment?
* Gotify:
  * mysql?
  * ingress
* Install glusterfs
