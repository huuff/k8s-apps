# Tasks
* Make `ingress-nginx` a `DaemonSet` (How do I do it declaratively? A patch? `kustomize`?) UPDATE: helm
* Why is the `emanote` container in the `exobrain` pod not logging anything?
* Try to set the `--control-plane-endpoint` to `cervantes.haff.xyz`
* Try to set a load balancer for all nodes so I can point my subdomains there

## Observability service account chart
* Pass namespace as a value
* Pass role name as value
